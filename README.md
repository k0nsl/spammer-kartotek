# spammer-kartotek
A carefully curated database of spam data. This database is maintained by k0nsl (i.am@k0nsl.org) and all of the recorded entries have been appropriated from services which are entirely operated by myself. There are no third-party sources lifted to my database. The database is manually curated by me on my spare time.

I try not to add entire subnets, if possible.

## What type of spam?
This database contains mostly data gathered from e-mail spam destined to my own personal e-mail account and that of my clients.
